# Sensor Data Collection and Action Recognition

This project demonstrates how to collect sensor data from mobile sensors (Accelerometer, DeviceMotion, Gyroscope) in a React Native Expo app and perform action recognition using a pre-trained model.

The app collects sensor data for a specific duration and then uses the collected data to make predictions on the recognized action. The predicted action is based on the highest value in the output array from the model.

## Features

- Collects sensor data from Accelerometer, DeviceMotion, and Gyroscope sensors.
- Formats the collected data into a specific shape for further processing.
- Uses a pre-trained model to perform action recognition.
- Identifies the predicted action based on the highest value in the model's output array.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (>=12.0.0)
- npm or yarn package manager
- Expo CLI

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```

git clone <https://github.com/yourusername/sensor-data-action-recognition.git>

```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```

cd sensor-data-action-recognition

```

3. Install the dependencies:

```

npm install

```

or

```

yarn install

```

## Usage

1. Connect your mobile device or use an emulator.
2. Start the Expo development server:

```

expo start

```

3. Scan the QR code with the Expo Go app on your mobile device or use an emulator to run the app.
4. Allow the necessary permissions for accessing the sensors.
5. The app will start collecting sensor data for the specified duration.
6. After collecting the data, the app will use the pre-trained model to predict the action based on the collected sensor data.
7. The predicted action will be displayed in the console log.

## Screenshots

- Add screenshots of your app here to showcase its functionality and user interface. For example:
